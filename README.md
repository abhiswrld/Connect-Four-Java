# Connect Four (Java Console Edition)

A robust, console-based implementation of the classic strategy game Connect Four, built in Java. This project demonstrates core computer science concepts including 2D array manipulation, algorithm design (win-detection), and user input validation.

## Features
* **Dynamic Rendering:** The game board updates in real-time after every move.
* **ANSI Color Support:** Uses ANSI escape codes to render Red (Player 1), Yellow (Player 2), and Purple (Winning Line) directly in the terminal.
* **Robust Input Validation:** "Bouncer" logic prevents crashes by handling non-integer inputs and out-of-bounds errors.
* **Optimized Logic:** Checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins efficiently.

## How to Run
1.  Ensure you have Java installed.
2.  Compile the source code:
    ```bash
    javac ConnectFour.java
    ```
3.  Run the game:
    ```bash
    java ConnectFour
    ```

## Technical Highlights
* **Language:** Java
* **Concepts:** multidimensional arrays, control flow, exception handling (Scanner), algorithm design (O(N*M)) complexity for win checks).
